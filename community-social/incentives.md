Please read how to contribute in our guide in the repo's README.

**Designer?**

Create a sticker pack for Telegram [t.me/SaltSwap](https://t.me/SaltSwap), the top 3 most voted will earn a big chunk of SALT rewards.

**Do you speak a language other than English?**

Open a local SALT community in your local language on Telegram and we will fund you.
