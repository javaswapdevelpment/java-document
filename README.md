# JavaSwap, get java!

**Why JAVA?**

We are a team of experienced software developers and product managers from top tier tech companies (aka the javas) that want to contribute to the BSC DeFi yield farm movement and take it to the next level.

Even though we are starting off with a java yield farm, we will quickly move on to bigger and greater things. We have big plans for the JAVA token as you can see in our [roadmap](roadmap.md), we are in the short term planning do put development effort into the following:

- Binary options
- Launchpools (stake JAVA get tokens)
- Lottery (not only a chance for you to win more JAVA but also a Burning Mechanism to keep the value of the token high)

We feel most projects in the space are a wee bit flavorless, so we are planning to add a little grain of java and make them tastier. Get java!

Join us and taste our new flavoured java token!

**How?**

We are launching a yield farm with a fair token distribution! No premine, reward start announced in advance, and no F&F getting allocs. We believe this is super fair and everyone can enjoy the java yields.

**What do you get then?**

We believe that the usage of the farm will be enough for us to get the dev funds needed to cover expenses and pay the incentives.

JavaSwap uses PancakeSwap.finance awesomeness to drive our liquidity pools and swaps.

**Why Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)?**

To be honest, it's a no brainer. In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance's ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future. Sure, launching on Ethereum would be the easiest thing to do and probably receive faster initial uptake, but we like a challenge and are betting on BSC's future.

Faster, cheaper. **Sold.**

**What makes JavaSwap different from every other ‚Äúfarm‚Äù?**

We're a team of experienced developers who really enjoy the DeFi movement and are willing do dedicate our time to take this project to the next level.
