**Fees:**

JavaSwap collects a 3% deposit fee to periodically purchase JAVA on the market and burn them. This will reduce the supply and pump your bags!

**Time lock**

We will be adding a timelock contract as the owner of the masterchef. The timelock will be activated with a **24h delay**, this should give you enough time to validate any of our transactions.
