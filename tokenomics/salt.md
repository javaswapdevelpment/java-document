**Chain:** Binance Smart Chain \(BEP-20\)

**Emission rate:**

- **Reward per block** - 1.1 SALT
- **Daily emission \(Based on 30k blocks per day\)** - 31,000 SALT per day

**Deflationary Mechanics:**

- Farms & pools will get corresponding SALT depending on the multiplier shown on the top right corner;
- ~9.09% will be sent to the developer's address for further development of the platform;
- As soon as the lottery is implemented, 20% of the pot will be burned.

**Distribution:**

- **Farmers** - 90.9% of the rewards per block \(1 SALT\)
- **Farmers daily** - 30,000 SALT \(based on 30k blocks per day\)
- **Devs** - ~9.09% of the rewards per block \(0.1 SALT\)

**Fees:**

SaltSwap collects a 3% deposit fee to periodically purchase SALT on the market and burn them. This will reduce the supply and pump your bags!

**Time lock**

We will be adding a timelock contract as the owner of the masterchef. The timelock will be activated with a **24h delay**, this should give you enough time to validate any of our transactions.
